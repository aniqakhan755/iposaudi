    <h3 class="content-heading">How an Advisor Helps During IPO Journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
        A detailed self-assessment will enable the company to determine if going public is a step in the right
        direction. If so, the company can start preparing for the IPO. It’s not feasible for companies to manage the
        whole IPO process themselves without impacting their core business because of the time and effort it requires.
        Moreover, as the IPO process represents an unchartered territory for most companies, hiring experts throughout
        the process would be beneficial both from a cost and time perspective.
